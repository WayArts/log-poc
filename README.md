# Log-poc
Proof of Concept of log. Basic simple functions of Log, that use its creator.<br>
Log-poc is a project for collecting and simply analyzing of some data that are important for its creator.<br>
The creation of Log-poc is inspired by the idea of creating a full-featured Log app.<br>
It collects data about HR and some health parameters, analyzes it, like estimates daily calories or some more.<br>
Also it helps to organize activities, provides convenient timers, collects data about working hours,<br>
and helps in learning how to rest. Like: feel yourself safe during the rest period if you don't do anything<br>
(or almost anything), which means you turn OFF discomfort that makes you feel the need to act, and feel yourself <br>
safe during the work period if you do work, which means you turn ON discomfort that makes you feel the need to act, <br>
but you turn OFF discomfort if you act. <br>
*Remark: we only like things that help us get away from discomfort, so those who might think that basing work on discomfort <br>
is bad don't realize that they themselves are doing things in the first place because if they don't, they will feel discomfort. <br>
Pleasant emotions are only born when the discomfort goes away. If there is no discomfort, there will be no pleasant <br>
emotions, and there will be no action.<br>*
